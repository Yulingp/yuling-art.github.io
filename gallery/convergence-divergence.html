          <p>I drew this as a thank-you gift to my ex-husband before our divorce. The drawing manifests our paths coming together a few times, those intense years as a couple (we went through lots of uncertainty together), and finally going on our separate paths.</p>
          <p>Luckily, we both feel the other person made us a better human during our relationship :)</p>
          <p>Drawn with lots of love and best wishes for us both.</p>
