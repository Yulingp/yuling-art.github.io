          <p>You might have heard that we create our own reality.</p>
          <p>A large part of my 2022 has been challenging. My life was shaken to the core, and my beliefs were tested repeatedly. Finally, close to the end of the tunnel, I felt I could be "in charge" of the world I was experiencing. The power is in my hands.</p>
